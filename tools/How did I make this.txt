[How did I do that?]

1. Blockly made this possible.

(https://developers.google.com/blockly)

2. I also make 1 blockly game before but that
was bad.

3. If you want to make your own game, you must
know atleast JavaScript |1|, some HTML and 1-3% CSS.
Then, click on "GUIDES".

4. Done! Also with help of Agastya.

[REFERENCES]

1 - You need to know the following in JS:

numbers, booleans, arrays, functions, strings, and more!
