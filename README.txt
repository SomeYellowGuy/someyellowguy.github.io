Q/A:

Q: It is not showing the game! It only shows the buttons!

A: You have to enable JavaScript. This game heavily depends on JavaScript. Search on
Google on how to do that. (Also, you can't just drag the index.html to another folder and
play it because the game depends on the contents of the folder!)

{To check if you have enabled JS, go to tools/check_js.html}

Q: I don't know what to do in this game!

A: Click on the help button for help.

Q: Why does this weigh a megabyte?

A: The files "blockly_compressed.js" [605 KB] (For the blocks), "acorn-interpreter.js [73 KB]" (For stepping (for Blockly)) and "segoeui.woff [476 KB]" (For font) make up 1.12MB.
